# RetailDB

RetailDB is a sample SQL-based database project that simulates the operations of a retail business. 
It is designed to help developers, analysts, and students understand relational database design, data relationships, and practical SQL querying in a retail context.

This project was created by **Maurice Hazan**, a self-driven developer with hands-on experience in SQL, data modeling, and legacy systems like AS/400. 
Maurice built RetailDB and several other full-scale, real world scenarios databases to strengthen his data portfolio and demonstrate real-world database structuring, normalization, and complex joinsâ€”all foundational to operational reporting in business environments.

## ðŸ’¼ Project Overview

This database models key areas of a retail operation, including:

- **Customers**: Contact and location info for each customer.
- **Suppliers**: Companies that provide products.
- **Products**: Retail items, including pricing, stock, and descriptions.
- **Orders**: Purchase transactions from customers.
- **OrderDetails**: Line items that make up each order.
- **Inventory**: Logs for restocks and sales affecting stock levels.
- **Payments**: Payment method, amount, and transaction status.

## ðŸ§± Database Structure

Hereâ€™s a high-level view of how the tables relate:
Customers â”€â”¬â”€ Orders â”€â”¬â”€ OrderDetails â”€â”¬â”€ Products â”€â”¬â”€ Suppliers
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Payments â””â”€â”€ Inventory

Each table includes realistic fields such as timestamps, foreign key constraints, default values, and appropriate data types.

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `schema.sql` â€“ All `CREATE TABLE` statements and foreign key definitions.
- `data.sql` â€“ Insert statements with sample data (customers, suppliers, products, orders, and inventory events).
- `queries.sql` â€“ A JOIN query that provides a detailed view of retail operations, combining data across multiple tables.

## ðŸ§ª Sample Output (Final Query)

The final query in `queries.sql` returns:

- Order information (OrderID, Date, Status)
- Customer details (Name, Email)
- Product info (Name, Category)
- Supplier name
- Purchase details (Quantity, Unit Price, Total per line item)
- Payment info (Method and Status)
- Inventory change data (Restock or Sale activity)
